# Calibration - Overview

## Goal
Define calibration workflows, especially solar noise calibration, as incremental specs.

## Non-goals
- No implementation during Phase 1 refactor.

## Key concepts
- Sweep/scan strategy around expected sun position
- Measurement acquisition from receiver chain
- SNR / noise power metrics
- Calibration result persistence
