# Tracking - Overview

## Goal
Define tracking features (computations + UI workflows) as separate, incremental specs.

## Non-goals
- This folder does not mandate implementation order.
- Implementation occurs only after Phase 1 refactor is accepted.

## Key concepts
- Observer location (lat/lon/alt)
- Targets: satellites, radio sources, custom objects
- Outputs: azimuth/elevation/time series + event markers
